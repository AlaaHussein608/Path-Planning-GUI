# Path-Planning-GUI

A comprehensive graphical user interface for robot path planning and simulation. This application allows users to define environments with obstacles, set robot parameters, select from multiple path planning algorithms, and visualize both the planned path and robot motion through various plotting and animation tools.

## Features

### üèóÔ∏è Environment Setup
- **Rectangle Obstacles**: Define rectangular obstacles with position and size parameters
- **Flexible Workspace**: Create custom environments by adding multiple obstacles

### ü§ñ Robot Configuration
- **Start & Goal Positions**: Set initial and target positions for the robot
- **Visual Confirmation**: Points are visually confirmed in the environment

### üß† Path Planning Algorithms
Choose from five sophisticated path planning algorithms:

- **Dijkstra**: Classic shortest-path algorithm with guaranteed optimality
- **A***: Heuristic-based search with optimal path guarantee
- **Artificial Potential Fields (APF)**: Gradient-based approach using attractive and repulsive forces
- **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)**: Sampling-based method for complex environments
- **RRT***: Optimal variant of RRT with asymptotic optimality

### üìä Simulation & Visualization
- **Trajectory Plotting**: Visualize the complete planned path
- **Wheel Dynamics**: Monitor angular velocities of left and right wheels
- **Orientation Analysis**: Track robot orientation throughout the path
- **Real-time Animation**: Watch the robot navigate with orientation indicators

### üéÆ Control Strategies

**Cosine Switch Control** (Dijkstra & A*):
- High precision path following
- Stops at each waypoint for reorientation
- Ideal for structured environments with clear waypoints

**Proportional Control** (APF, RRT, RRT*):
- Continuous smooth motion
- Constant velocity operation
- Efficient for complex, curved paths
- Minimal stopping and reorientation

## Algorithm Recommendations

### For Simple Environments
- **Dijkstra/A***: Best for grid-based environments with optimal path requirements
- **Cosine Switch Control**: Provides pinpoint accuracy

### For Complex Environments
- **RRT/RRT***: Ideal for cluttered spaces and high-dimensional problems
- **APF**: Suitable for dynamic environments and real-time applications
- **Proportional Control**: Offers smooth, efficient motion


## APF Algorithm Modifications

This implementation includes several key modifications to the standard Artificial Potential Fields algorithm to improve performance and address common issues:

### Modified Repulsive Force Function
The repulsive force calculation has been enhanced with additional terms that:
- **Scale with goal proximity**: The repulsive force decreases as the robot approaches the goal, allowing smoother final approach
- **Include higher-order terms**: Additional polynomial terms provide more nuanced obstacle avoidance behavior
- **Balance attraction and repulsion**: The force calculation maintains equilibrium between reaching the goal and avoiding obstacles

### Dynamic Influence Radius (œÅ)
- **Obstacle-size adaptive**: The influence radius œÅ is calculated based on obstacle dimensions, making larger obstacles have proportionally larger influence areas
- **Scaled threshold**: A scaling factor of 1√ó the maximum obstacle dimension provides balanced obstacle detection range

### Fixed Step Size Motion
- **Deterministic movement**: The robot moves with a constant step size in the computed direction
- **Stable convergence**: Fixed steps prevent overshooting and ensure predictable motion toward the goal
- **Direction-based updates**: Movement follows the potential field gradient using trigonometric components

### Jitter Mechanism for Local Minima Escape
A specialized jitter function prevents getting stuck in local minima by:
- **Lateral exploration**: Introducing small perpendicular movements when progress stalls
- **Collision-aware adjustments**: Verifying potential new positions for collision avoidance before moving
- **Adaptive direction sampling**: Testing multiple angular offsets from the current direction to find viable escape paths
- **Controlled displacement**: Using reduced step size (20% of normal) for delicate maneuvering in congested areas

These modifications collectively address common APF limitations such as local minima traps, oscillatory behavior near obstacles, and inefficient path smoothing near the goal region.
